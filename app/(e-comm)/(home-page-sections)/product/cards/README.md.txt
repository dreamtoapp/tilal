# Product Card Performance & Minimalism: Best Practices

## Why Optimize Product Cards?
- Faster load times = better UX & SEO
- Less HTML = less re-rendering, better mobile performance
- Top e-commerce sites (Amazon, Shopify, Zalando) use minimal, focused cards

---

## 1. **Minimal HTML Structure**
- Only render essential elements: image, name, price, key action (add to cart/wishlist)
- Avoid deep nesting, unnecessary wrappers, or excessive divs
- Use semantic tags where possible (e.g., `<button>`, `<h3>`, `<figure>`, `<img>`)

## 2. **Image Optimization**
- Use `next/image` with `priority` for above-the-fold cards (first 8)
- Set `sizes` and `quality` props for responsive, sharp images
- Use descriptive `alt` text (product name + key attribute)
- Prefer WebP/AVIF formats for smaller size
- Only show 1 image per card (thumbnails/extra images on detail/quick view)

## 3. **Text Content**
- Product name: concise, 1-2 lines, use `line-clamp`
- Price: always visible, highlight discounts with a badge
- Avoid long descriptions or specs in the card (show on detail/quick view)

## 4. **Actions**
- Only show primary action (add to cart or wishlist)
- Use icon buttons, not text links, for secondary actions
- Avoid showing too many buttons (compare, share, etc.) unless analytics show high usage

## 5. **Accessibility**
- Use `aria-label` on interactive elements
- Ensure card is keyboard navigable (tabIndex, keydown for Enter/Space)
- Use sufficient color contrast

## 6. **Performance**
- Memoize card components (React.memo)
- Avoid inline functions/handlers in render
- Use CSS for hover/focus, not JS
- Defer analytics/events to after interaction

## 7. **SEO**
- Use structured data (JSON-LD) for product info (name, price, availability)
- Use descriptive `alt` and `title` attributes for images

## 8. **Mobile First**
- Test card on small screens: tap targets, font size, spacing
- Avoid hover-only features

2. **HTML Simplification:**
   - Audit for unnecessary wrappers/divs, especially in the card and media sections.
3. **Monitor Analytics:**

4. **Continue Current Strengths:**
   - Image optimization, accessibility, SEO, and mobile responsiveness are strongâ€”maintain these.
