# Category Image Guidelines

## Recommended Image Size for Categories

- **Optimal Size:** 1024 x 1024 px (square)
- **Aspect Ratio:** 1:1 (square)
- **File Size:** Keep under 500 KB for fast loading
- **Format:** JPEG for photos, PNG/WebP for graphics or transparency

## Why?
- Matches industry standards (Shopify, Amazon, etc.)
- Ensures sharp, professional look on all devices
- Square images are easiest to handle responsively and look best in grids

## Best Practices
- Use the same size and aspect ratio for all category images
- Use 2x the display size for retina screens (e.g., if container is 288x288 px, upload at least 576x576 px)
- Compress images before upload (TinyPNG, WebP, etc.)
- Use descriptive alt text for accessibility
