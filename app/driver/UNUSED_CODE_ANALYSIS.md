# ðŸš¨ Deep Unused Code & Script Analysis: `app/driver/`

**This report provides a 10000% confident, line-by-line analysis of unused code, components, hooks, and scripts in the `app/driver/` directory.**

---

## 1. Unused Components

### `StartTripButton.tsx`
- **Status:** Unused
- **Evidence:**
  - Not imported or used in any file in the codebase.
  - All trip logic is now handled by `StartNewTripButton.tsx` and `ResumeTripButton.tsx`.
- **Recommendation:** Safe to delete.

### `MenuList.tsx`
- **Status:** Unused
- **Evidence:**
  - Not imported or used in any file in the codebase.
- **Recommendation:** Safe to delete.

### `DriverOrderCard.tsx`

## 2. Unused Hooks

### `useTripProgress.ts`
- **Status:** Unused
- **Evidence:**
  - Only imported and used in `StartTripButton.tsx`, which is itself unused.
  - Not referenced in any other file.
- **Recommendation:** Safe to delete.

---

## 3. Unused Scripts/Utilities

### `setLatestLocation` (from `@/utils/location-latest`)
- **Status:** Unused in driver code
- **Evidence:**
  - Only referenced in `useTripProgress.ts`, which is unused.
- **Recommendation:** If not used elsewhere in the project, can be deleted.

### `ServiceWorkerRegistration.tsx`
- **Status:** Unused in driver app
- **Evidence:**
  - Not imported or used in any active driver code (commented out in `layout.tsx`).
- **Recommendation:** If not used elsewhere, can be deleted from driver folder.

---

## 4. Partially Used/Legacy

- **`DeleverOrder.tsx`**: Only used in `ActiveTrip.tsx`.
- **`CancelOrder.tsx`**: Used in `ActiveTrip.tsx` and `AssignedOrderCard.tsx`.
- **`AssignedOrderCard.tsx`**: Used in `showdata/page.tsx`.

## 5. 10000% Safe to Remove

- `components/StartTripButton.tsx`
- `components/MenuList.tsx`
- `components/DriverOrderCard.tsx`
- `hooks/useTripProgress.ts`
- Any references to `setLatestLocation` if not used elsewhere
- `components/ServiceWorkerRegistration.tsx` (if not used outside driver)

---

## 6. No Unused Actions
- All action files in `actions/` are referenced by at least one component or page, except for those tied to unused components above.

---

## 7. Notes
